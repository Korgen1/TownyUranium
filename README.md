# TownyUranium
A very simple plugin for Towny to stop players from using slimefun radioactive items for combat in towns with PvP off

Inside of plots / towns with PvP disabled only the player that dropped the radioactive item can pick it up.

# Permissions
 - tu.bypassdrop (Players with this permissions dropped radioactive items can be picked up by anyone)
 - tu.bypasspickup (Players with this permission can pickup any radioactive items)
 
 # Dependencies 
 - Towny Advanced - Tested with latest pre-release but I don't see why it wouldn't work on most versions
 
 - Slimefun
 
 Tested on 1.16.3, probably would work on other versions but I have not tested it
